# Coffee Sales — Business Report

## Problem Statement
Lift total revenue by 10–15% next quarter while keeping service time low and stockouts under 1% of orders.

## Objectives
- Identify top products, timings, and payment patterns driving sales.
- Use seasonality (weekday/month) to plan inventory and campaigns.
- Prioritize actions that increase throughput in peak windows.

## Key Findings (from EDA)
- Latte is the #1 revenue driver.
- Card appears to be the dominant payment method.
- Night and Afternoon generate the highest revenue among dayparts.
- Tuesday is the best weekday; March is the peak month.
- Peak selling hour clusters near mid-morning (around 10:00).

## Recommendations
1. **Merchandising & Bundles**
   - Feature Latte plus two add-ons; create morning combos (e.g., Cappuccino + pastry) to upsell.
2. **Ops & Staffing**
   - Align barista staffing to Tuesday & mid-morning peaks; consider prep for Night/Afternoon rush.
3. **Payments**
   - Ensure card terminals are abundant and fast; offer small incentive to move remaining cash users to card.
4. **Inventory & Procurement**
   - Pre-stock before March and other rising months; reduce low-movement SKUs.
5. **Pricing Experiments**
   - Micro A/B test +/-3–5% price on mid-tier items in off-peak months to gauge elasticity.

## KPI Targets (Next Quarter)
- +12% revenue vs. last quarter baseline.
- < 1% stockouts, < 4 min average service time in peak hour.
- +5% card transaction share (if not already near saturation).
